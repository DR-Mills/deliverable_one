	 * Point Breakdown:
	 * Each of these requirements are worth 1 or 2 points with a total of 10. You need to:
	 * 1) Print a message asking the user to input a password via the console (1 point)
	 * 2) Receive the input via the console (1 point)
	 * 3) Check if there is at least one lowercase letter (1 point)
	 * 4) Check if there is at least one uppercase letter (Hint: Google Java check if string contains lowercase/uppercase) (1 point)
	 * 5) Check if there are at least 7 characters (1 point)
	 * 6) Check if there are no more than 12 characters (1 point)
	 * 7) Check if there is a ! (1 point)
	 * 8) If the password is valid, print "Password valid and
